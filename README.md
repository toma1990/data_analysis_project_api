Code from the Team Software Engineering module at the University of Lincoln. The project was for data analysis and we as a group decided to analyse the data of whether inbound flights affected the spread of COVID. This was presented via website which can be found: http://tse-group-8.herokuapp.com/. I was responsible for the API for the website.
